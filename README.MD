# Welcome to the Skyrim Open Idle System
### A completely open-source and community managed alternative to the infamous FNIS

Plans / TODO:
- [ ] Reverse Engineer backend FNIS source code
- [ ] Figure out the patching system -- this stuff is complicated, and may take a while
- [ ] Compilation needs to be worked on, need to engineer either a bridge between old FNIS template files and any possible newer replacements
- [ ] Backend code needs to be written, tested and trialed
- [ ] A friendly UI!
- [ ] Bugfixes, testing (especially with MO) and more
- [ ] Release
